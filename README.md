🧭 Travel Package Recommendation System
📌 Overview

The Travel Package Recommendation System is an intelligent web application built using Streamlit and Machine Learning (KNN - Cosine Similarity) to recommend personalized travel packages based on user preferences such as departure city, destination, trip duration, cost, and travel type.

The app helps users explore similar travel packages from a large dataset by finding the most relevant trips that match their interests and budget.

🚀 Features

✅ Interactive UI – Built using Streamlit for a clean and easy-to-use interface.
✅ Smart Recommendations – Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with cosine similarity to suggest top matching travel packages.
✅ Data Preprocessing – Encodes categorical data using OneHotEncoder and normalizes numerical values with MinMaxScaler.
✅ Dynamic Filtering – Destination and type options update automatically based on the user’s selected city.
✅ Scalable Design – Works seamlessly with large datasets (e.g., 200k+ records).

🏗️ Tech Stack
Component	Description
Language	Python
Frontend	Streamlit
ML Algorithm	K-Nearest Neighbors (Cosine Similarity)
Libraries Used	pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, streamlit
Dataset	travel_packages_200k.csv (custom dataset with travel packages)
📊 Dataset Structure

Ensure your dataset file is named travel_packages_200k.csv and contains the following columns:

Column	Description
Package_ID	Unique package identifier
From_City	Departure city
Destination	Travel destination
Destination_Type	Type of destination (e.g., Beach, Historical, Adventure)
Trip_Duration_Days	Number of days for the trip
Budget_Range	Price category
Approx_Cost (₹)	Approximate cost in INR
Accommodation_Type	Hotel / Resort / Homestay, etc.
Transport_Mode	Bus / Flight / Train, etc.
Meal_Plan	Included meals
Activity_Count	Number of activities included
Activity_Types	Adventure / Cultural / Relaxation, etc.
Season	Best time to visit
Package_Type	Family / Solo / Couple / Group
Recommended_For	Ideal traveler category

🧠 How It Works

User Inputs preferences such as:

Departure City

Destination

Destination Type

Trip Duration

Approx Cost

Feature Engineering:

Categorical data → OneHotEncoded

Numerical data → MinMax Scaled

Model Training:

K-Nearest Neighbors (NearestNeighbors) model fits all travel packages.

Cosine similarity metric identifies top 5 closest matches.

Recommendations Display:

Top 5 most similar packages are shown with similarity scores.

🛠️ Future Enhancements

Integrate Google Maps API for visual trip locations.

Add user reviews and ratings.

Implement Deep Learning-based recommendation engine.

Add filter options (season, activities, budget range).
